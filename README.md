  
        hi im gui
 ___    i love game development and want to be indie someday
|'v'|/  i want to learn c++ to also enhance my chances at a carrer in software engineering
        (if my dreams never become true, which is possible in the shitty country that i live in)
        idk what github is really about
        if it's positivity and good things i'll be yay
         
- gggguilherme
- no social media (i like to be invisible) (is there some sort of chat system on github?)
- i like the godot engine and would colaborate to that, if i knew a thing about c++
- i started with java and tried making games with that
